ðŸ“˜ Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python
This project contains Python solutions for two basic tasks that demonstrate dictionary operations and list slicing, as part of learning core data structures in Python.

âœ… Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement:

Write a Python program that:

Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.

Asks the user to input a student's name.

Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.

If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message
